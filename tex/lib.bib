abstract = {This paper introduces a unified framework for the analysis of a class of random allocation processes that include: (i) the birthday paradox; (ii) the coupon collector problem; (iii) least-recently-used (LRU) caching in memory management systems under the independent reference model; (iv) the move-to-front heuristic of self-organizing search. All analyses are relative to general nonuniform probability distributions. Our approach to these problems comprises two stages. First, the probabilistic phenomena of interest are described by means of regular languages extended by addition of the shuffle product. Next, systematic translation mechanisms are used to derive integral representations for expectations and probability distributions.},

@misc{Rivest1978,
abstract = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

WSNs have attracted intensive interest from both academia and industry due to their wide application in civil and military scenarios. In hostile scenarios, it is very important to protect WSNs from malicious attacks. Due to various resource limitations and the salient features of a wireless sensor network, the security design for such networks is significantly challenging. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of WSN security issues that were investigated by researchers in recent years and that shed light on future directions for WSN security.},
